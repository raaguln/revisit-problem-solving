Top Down Unoptimized

Time - O(2^n)
- At each element, two choices: include or exclude
- Inclusion depends on divisibility with the previously included element, but in worst case can still branch twice at each step
- Maximum recursion depth is O(n)
- No memoization leads to exponential recomputation

Space - O(n)
- Recursion depth up to O(n)
- Each recursive call adds a frame to the call stack
- No additional data structures for memoization or DP

Bottom Up Optimized

Time - O(n^2)  
- Outer loop runs n times, inner loop runs up to n times  
- Each step does constant work to check divisibility and length comparison  
- Total operations = O(n^2)

Space - O(n^2) (worst case)  
- DP array of lists storing subsets  
- Each dp[i] can hold up to n elements in the worst case  

Explanation -  
i - current index in nums (considering nums[i:] suffix)  

DP logic -  
QUESTION -> What is the largest divisible subset starting at index i?

1. For each j > i:  
   - If nums[j] is divisible by nums[i], nums[i] can be prepended to dp[j]  
   - We choose dp[j] with the longest length to extend from  
2. dp[i] = [nums[i]] + longest dp[j] where nums[j] % nums[i] == 0  

Final Answer -  
- The longest subset among all dp[i] is the largest divisible subset in nums

Table - Step 0 after initialization (example nums = [1, 2, 4, 8]) â†’  
dp array holds subsets starting at each index:

i | dp[i]  
---|-------  
3 | [8]  
2 | [4, 8]  
1 | [2, 4, 8]  
0 | [1, 2, 4, 8]  

Answer: dp[0] = [1, 2, 4, 8]
