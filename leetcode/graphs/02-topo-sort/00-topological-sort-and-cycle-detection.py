- Topological ordering - one graph can have multiple valid ones
- Can be only done for DAG

Use cases - 
1. dependencies, prerequisites, course/event schedules


'''
# Order the nodes of a DAG in a way that every edge
# from u to v, u comes before v in the ordering

# Algo - dfs() and add to stack whenever a node has no more neighbors.
# Pop the entire stack, this is our topological order (or stack[::-1])

'''
DFS Toplogical sort
Time Complexity: O(V + E)  
- Each node is visited once, and each edge is explored once during DFS traversal.

Space Complexity: O(V + E)  
- O(V) for the visited list and recursion stack (in worst case), and O(E) for the adjacency list.

- array to keep track of in-degree of each node
