DFS (Time limit exceeded)
Time Complexity:
In the worst case, the dfs will be called on each course multiple times.
Since you do not memoize the results or mark courses as completed, the same subproblems (courses) can be revisited repeatedly.
The complexity can degrade to O(N Ã— E) where:
N = number of courses (numCourses)
E = number of edges (prerequisites)
This happens because each DFS call can traverse edges multiple times without pruning.

Space Complexity:
The recursion stack can go as deep as the longest chain of prerequisites, which is O(N) in the worst case.
The visited set can also grow to size O(N).
The prereqs dictionary takes O(N + E) space.

Optimized DFS
Time -
Here, once a course is determined finishable, its prerequisites are cleared (prereqs[course] = []), so subsequent calls to dfs(course) return immediately.
This memoization ensures each course is processed at most once.
Each edge (prerequisite) is traversed at most once.
Overall time complexity is O(N + E), where:
N is the number of courses
E is the number of prerequisite edges

Space - 
The recursion stack depth remains O(N) in the worst case.
The visited set is still at most size O(N).
The prereqs dictionary still occupies O(N + E) space.
Because of memoization, no redundant recursive calls increase stack usage beyond that.
