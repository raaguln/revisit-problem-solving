https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort/description/

Dijkstra's, but instead of accumulating cost with +, 
we take max() of the path so far and the current moveâ€™s difference.

Time Complexity Discussion:  
- Each cell is pushed into the heap at most once: O(m * n) heap operations.  
- Each heap operation (push/pop) takes O(log(m * n)).  
- So total time complexity is O((m * n) * log(m * n)).

Space Complexity Discussion:  
- Effort matrix takes O(m * n) space.  
- Heap can grow up to O(m * n) elements.  

Final Complexity:  
Time Complexity: O((m * n) * log(m * n))  
Space Complexity: O(m * n)
