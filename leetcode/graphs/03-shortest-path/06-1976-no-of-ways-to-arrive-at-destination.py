Use a modified Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm with two arrays/lists:
dist[node] = shortest distance to node.
ways[node] = number of shortest paths to node.

Algorithm steps:
Initialize dist with infinity except dist[0] = 0.
Initialize ways with 0 except ways[0] = 1 (one way to start at node 0).
Use a min-heap priority queue to pick the next node with the smallest distance.
For each neighbor:
    If a shorter distance is found, update dist and reset ways.
    If a distance equal to the shortest is found, add ways count.
