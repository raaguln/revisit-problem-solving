https://leetcode.com/problems/most-stones-removed-with-same-row-or-column/description/

key insight is that stones connected by row or column form connected components, 
and the maximum stones removable is total stones minus number of connected components.

Because row and column values both come from the same integer range 
(e.g., 0 to 10,000), just using x and y directly as node ids would 
cause collisions â€” for example, row 3 and column 3 would both be 
represented as 3, causing ambiguity.

Time - O(M) - m is edges
