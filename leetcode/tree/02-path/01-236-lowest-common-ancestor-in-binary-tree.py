        1. root = p = q -> root is the LCA
        2. p&q are in left -> each node, check if node = p or node = q, if so return node value (one of our elements), else return None. Two cases - 
            - p=7, q=4, on recursion 2 receives both values - then that is our LCA
            - p=7, q=2, on recursion 2 receives one value - again that is our LCA
        3. p&q are in right -> same as above
        4. p&q are split -. root is the LCA

        - If the root itself matches both `p` and `q` (i.e., they are the same node), it returns the root directly.
        - If the current node is `None`, it returns `None`.
        - If the current node matches either `p` or `q`, it returns the current node (found one of the targets).
        - It then recursively searches the left and right subtrees.
        - If **both** left and right subtrees return non-null results, it means:
        - `p` was found in one subtree and `q` in the other.
        - Hence, the current node is their **lowest common ancestor**.
        - If only one side returns a non-null result, it bubbles that result up â€” meaning both `p` and `q` are in that subtree.
